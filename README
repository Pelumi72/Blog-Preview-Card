## Overview

This project of a blog preview card was done using HTML and CSS. The Qr-Code project before this helped a lot in this project.

## My process

I arranged the structure of the code with HTML code and then used CSS to style from the general element e.g the body to the more specific ones like the classes. I also used the experience I gained from the last project to help me on this.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

My understanding of the display flex and how it works has improved. This project allowed me to use the hover state.

### Continued development

I will like to learn how to refactor my code better.

### Useful resources

- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me to understand some CSS properties a little more than I did.
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped me the same way W3schools helped.
